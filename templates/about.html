        Among all legendary creatures, the dragons (derived from Greek δράκων or drákōn) have taken their unique place among
        the pedestals of mythological accounts as well as present-day popular culture. And quite interestingly, dragons (or
        at least dragon-like entities) have been symbolic fixtures from a myriad of regions across the world. Of course,
        many of these mythical traditions have developed and evolved distinctly without much influence from one another, and
        yet the monsters have commonly played their major parts as gods, demons, and even personifications of nationalism.
        So, without further ado, let us take a gander at ten mythical dragon entities from cultures across the planet that
        you might not have known about.

            <h3>Akhekh (from Egypt)</h3>
            <p>
                Also known as Akhekhu, the Akhekh is characterized as a fantastical beast with a long serpentine body that is
                supported by its four legs. The mythical dragon was said to reside in remote corners of the Egyptian lands, mainly
                around the fringe desert areas beside the fertile Nile valley. And interestingly enough, the tales of the Akhekh
                drake might have inspired the legends of the Griffins in Europe. This gradual evolution of folkloric traditions can
                be substantiated by the later depictions of the Akhekh – in which the creature maintains its serpentine profile with
                the ancient Egyptian headgear (Uraei), albeit with an antelope’s body and a bird’s head.

            <h3>Drakon Kholkikos (from Kolkhis or Georgia)</h3>
            <p>
                If the legend of the ‘Jason and the Argonauts’ was an adventure game, the Drakon Kholkikos (or simply Colchian
                Dragon) would have been the main boss who guarded the Golden Fleece – that was located in the sacred grove of Ares
                at Kolkhis (present-day central Georgia). Described as having a crest, three tongues and a magical set of teeth,
                there are different versions as to how the mythical dragon met its untimely death – with some concluding with the
                ubiquitous scenario of the hero slaying the dragon, and some alluding to a situation where the witch Medea puts the
                dragon to sleep with her magic. There is also a third version where the great singer Orpheus lures the dragon with
                an enchanting musical rendition on his lyre.
